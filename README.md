# RetroHub

### An upcoming emulator front-end designed to be deeply customized!

---

This is currently a work in progress but being heavily developed and hopefully an alpha will be released within the year.

The core change from popular emulator fronteds like EmulationStation and Pegasus is that RetroHub was designed such that themes have near full control of their look and behavior. By leveraging the Godot engine, themes are created as Godot scenes, and thus can be anything, from regular 2D interfaces to full 3D hub worlds.

Other than that, it also aims to offer a better controller experience out of the box, and a better user-friendly usage overall.

Stay tuned for more news and updates, hopefully very shortly!
