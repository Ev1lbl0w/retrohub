# RetroHub - Retro-gaming library frontend

RetroHub is a frontend application, allowing you to manage and launch your retro-gaming library. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, yet packed with features and highly customizable.

RetroHub leverages the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) to provide a powerful 2D and 3D game engine for theme developers. This way, themes can be very versatile and unique, creating a platform of endless possibilities for customizing your gaming setup.

> *Note*
> RetroHub is still in early development. Although it's ready for daily usage, do not move your library setup if you're already using another frontend.
